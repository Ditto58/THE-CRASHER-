# THE-CRASHER-
OK! So, DO NOT run ANY virus protection sofware in this folder. For whatever reason,
when I tried to send the original MyApp.bat (1.0) through Gmail to my friend, Andie, it
said something like this; "Virus Detected. Can't Send". So, yeah. Just don't. Also, Im 
going to have a little ad at the end, because WE NEED HELP! 


NOWS YOUR CHANCE TO BE A BIG SHOT!!! (yes, that was a Spamton referance)
HELP WANTED! Please submit a text file with your skills, and me and the Team will
review it. We need about... oh, 5 people. So, the race will be hard (probaly not. Maybe ,
though), and submit them fast! We may need more people, though. That means, yes, 
more people might be chosen!

SEE YA!

Ditto, The guy in charge, who dosen't know what he would be called in this situation.
